      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I played GoogleCTF to try out some of the challenges, since this CTF is highly rated on CTFTime.&#xA;The first challenges I solved were multiarch part 1 &amp;amp; 2, which I found to be the most interesting,&#xA;even though they were relatively easy compared to the rest of the CTF.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First part was a reverse engineering challenge, which isn’t my main category, but I do it because binary exploitation&#xA;usually requires some reversing in almost every challenge. This time, it was impossible for me to do the binary exploitation part without&#xA;reversing it first. The binary was a &amp;ldquo;virtual machine&amp;rdquo;-type challenge — an interpreter for custom bytecode provided with the challenge&#xA;in a file called &lt;code&gt;crackme.masm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
